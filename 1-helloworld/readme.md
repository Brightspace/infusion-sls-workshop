# Hello World

## Getting Started

Navigate to the working directory.

```sh
cd 1-helloworld
```

## Deploy

Everything you need is already available in this directory. Simply run the following command to deploy this Serverless app:

```sh
serverless deploy
```

## Invoke

Once the deploy has finished, you can invoke the `hello` function. The `invoke` command takes an argument `--function` (or `-f` for short) followed by the name of the function to invoke:

```sh
serverless invoke -f hello
```

This works because `serverless.yml` defines the function:

```yml
functions:
  hello:
    handler: index.handler
```

and `index.js` exports a function called `handler`:

```js
exports.handler = async () => {
  return 'Hello world!';
};
```

## Extra Credit

If you look in the `.serverless` directory, you will see a few files, one of which is called `cloudformation-template-update.json`. This is the infrastructure-as-code definition being generated by Serverless and sent to AWS during deployment. At any step in this workshop you can take a peek and see what else is being added to this file.
